## 3d-renderer
This is a simple 3d renderer in python for obj files + uv textures written with no graphics libraries. Can render wireframe, shaded and textured images. Will be improved in the future to have gourad shading, rotation, shadow tracing and more. Based loosely on https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer tutorial.
