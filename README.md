## 3d-renderer
This is a simple 3d renderer in python for obj files + uv textures to a bitmap file. The entirety of the renderer is written with no graphics libraries. Can render wireframe, shaded and textured images. Will be improved in the future to have smooth shading, rotation, shadow tracing and more. Based loosely on https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer ❤️.
